# 🚀 IsReal Elevator

STM32-based Embedded Elevator Control System  
AI On-Device Semiconductor Design – Project 2

---

## 📌 Overview

IsReal Elevator is a finite state machine (FSM)-based elevator control system implemented on STM32.

The project aims to replicate realistic elevator behavior through structured control logic, efficient floor request handling, and real-time user feedback.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a realistic elevator control system  
- Implement floor request and cancellation logic  
- Manage internal and hall call button inputs  
- Provide accurate real-time visual feedback  
- Support emergency stop functionality
